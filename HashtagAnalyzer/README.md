# 🔍 Hashtag Analyzer

Hashtag Analyzer is a **C++ program** that scans messages for specific hashtags, counts their occurrences, and displays trending hashtags. This project was developed for **CMSC 202 – Computer Science II** at **UMBC (University of Maryland, Baltimore County).**  

This project demonstrates **file handling, arrays, function-based design, and efficient text parsing** in C++.

## 📜 **Project Overview**
### **What This Project Does**
✅ **Reads a list of hashtags** from an input file.  
✅ **Loads messages from another file** and scans for matching hashtags.  
✅ **Counts and displays hashtag occurrences** across all messages.  
✅ **Handles multiple hashtag-message sets** without restarting.  
✅ **Implements structured programming with multiple functions**.  

This project **demonstrates structured C++ programming, file input/output, and array manipulation**.

## 🛠 **Key Skills Demonstrated**
- **C++ Development**: File handling, arrays, input validation.
- **Data Processing**: Reads structured text files and processes hashtags.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: **String parsing** and **frequency counting** for hashtags.
- **Modular Programming**: Uses **at least 5 functions** for structured program flow.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures valid input files and prevents crashes.

## 🎮 **How It Works (Simplified)**
### **Program Functionality**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **📂 Load Hashtags** | Reads `proj1_hashes.txt` and stores 20 hashtags in an array. |
| **📄 Load Messages** | Reads `proj1_t1.txt` (or similar) containing messages with hashtags. |
| **🔍 Scan Messages** | Checks each message for matching hashtags. |
| **📊 Count Hashtags** | Tracks the number of times each hashtag appears. |
| **🔄 Process Multiple Files** | Allows analyzing a new dataset without restarting. |
| **🚪 Exit Program** | Quits and displays a farewell message. |

### **Example Run**
1️⃣ **User enters the name of the hashtag file** (e.g., `proj1_hashes.txt`).  
2️⃣ **User enters the name of the message file** (e.g., `proj1_t1.txt`).  
3️⃣ **Program scans the messages and displays hashtag occurrences.**  
4️⃣ **User chooses to analyze another file or exit.**
