# 🃏 PyMatch

PyMatch is a **Python-based memory matching game** where players flip over cards to find matching symbols. Unlike traditional memory games, PyMatch allows different numbers of matching symbols per type, making it a **dynamic and strategy-based puzzle game**.  

This project was developed for **CMSC 201 – Computer Science I for Majors** at **UMBC (University of Maryland, Baltimore County).**  

This project demonstrates **Python programming fundamentals, 2D lists, input validation, and randomization for game logic**.

## 📜 **Project Overview**
### **What This Project Does**
✅ **Generates a dynamic memory board** using a randomized set of symbols.  
✅ **Implements turn-based gameplay**, where players attempt to match symbols.  
✅ **Handles different match conditions** (single, double, or multiple occurrences of symbols).  
✅ **Provides user feedback** on correct/incorrect guesses.  
✅ **Uses structured programming principles** for clean code organization.  

This project **demonstrates structured Python programming, game logic, and algorithmic thinking**.

## 🛠 **Key Skills Demonstrated**
- **Python Development**: Data structures, loops, and user input handling.
- **2D Lists & Game Board Management**: Grid-based card flipping mechanics.
- **Randomization & Seed Control**: Uses `random.choice()` for reproducible board setups.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Recursive symbol-matching logic.
- **Input Validation & Error Handling**: Ensures valid row/column selections.

## 🎮 **How It Works (Simplified)**
### **Program Functionality**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **📂 Load Symbols** | Reads a symbol file and populates the game board. |
| **🎲 Generate Game Board** | Randomly distributes symbols across a 2D grid. |
| **🃏 Flip Cards** | Players select positions to reveal cards. |
| **✅ Match Logic** | If symbols match, they remain revealed. If not, they are flipped back. |
| **📊 Track Remaining Symbols** | Displays how many matches are left for each symbol. |
| **🚪 Exit Game** | Allows the player to quit at any time. |

### **Example Gameplay**
1️⃣ **User inputs board dimensions and seed value for randomization.**  
2️⃣ **Symbols are read from a file and randomly assigned to the grid.**  
3️⃣ **Player selects a card position to reveal its symbol.**  
4️⃣ **If all copies of a symbol are revealed, they stay flipped.**  
5️⃣ **If not, the game provides feedback on how many remain.**  
6️⃣ **Incorrect guesses reset revealed positions for that turn.**  
7️⃣ **Game continues until all symbols are matched or player quits.**
