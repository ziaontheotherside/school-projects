# 🏁 UMBC Racer

UMBC Racer is a **C++ text-based racing game** where a human player competes against AI opponents to navigate obstacles and reach the finish line. This project was developed for **CMSC 202 – Computer Science II** at **UMBC (University of Maryland, Baltimore County).**  

The project reinforces **object-oriented programming (OOP), arrays, game logic, and structured C++ development** using multiple source files and a **makefile** for compilation.

## 📜 **Project Overview**
### **What This Project Does**
✅ **Simulates a turn-based racing game** with AI opponents.  
✅ **Implements obstacles** (Speed, Agility, and Jump) that players must navigate.  
✅ **Tracks player stats** (speed, agility, jump, races, wins, and falls).  
✅ **Uses object-oriented principles** with encapsulation and structured C++ programming.  
✅ **Manages a multi-file project** with `Player.h`, `Track.h`, and `Race.h`.  

This project **demonstrates structured C++ programming, game logic, and OOP fundamentals**.

## 🛠 **Key Skills Demonstrated**
- **C++ Development**: Multi-file program structure, makefiles, object-oriented design.
- **Data Structures**: **Arrays** (used for player tracking and obstacle management).
- **Game Logic & AI**: Simulated AI opponents with randomized decision-making.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
  - **Encapsulation & Classes** (`Player`, `Track`, `Race`).
  - **Constructors & Member Functions** (Player stats, race progression).
- **User Input Handling**: Validating and processing player choices.

## 🎮 **How It Works (Simplified)**
### **Program Functionality**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **🏁 Start a New Race** | Players compete against AI in a turn-based race. |
| **📊 View Racer Stats** | Displays total races, wins, falls, and player attributes. |
| **🎯 Navigate Obstacles** | Players and AI face Speed, Agility, or Jump challenges. |
| **📈 Improve Stats** | After winning, the player can upgrade Speed, Agility, or Jump. |
| **🚪 Exit Game** | Quits the program. |

### **Gameplay Example**
1️⃣ **Player selects "Start New Race"**  
2️⃣ **Chooses race length (1-100 obstacles)**  
3️⃣ **Encounters obstacles** (Speed, Agility, Jump)  
4️⃣ **Selects an action (Sprint, Dodge, Jump)**  
5️⃣ **Progresses through the race based on stats & RNG**  
6️⃣ **Winner is determined** – Player can upgrade a stat if they win.  

The game loops until the player quits.

## 🚀 **Why This Matters**
This project highlights my ability to:
✔️ **Develop structured C++ applications using OOP principles**.  
✔️ **Handle user input, game logic, and randomized AI behavior**.  
✔️ **Manage a multi-file C++ project with modular code**.  
✔️ **Use arrays for object storage and manage game state efficiently**.  

It showcases skills relevant to **game development, systems programming, and software engineering**.
