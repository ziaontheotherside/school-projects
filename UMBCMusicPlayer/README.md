# 🎵 UMBC Music Player

This is a **C++ project** that simulates a **personalized music playlist system**, developed for **CMSC 202 – Computer Science II** at **UMBC (University of Maryland, Baltimore County).**  

This project demonstrates **data structures, object-oriented programming (OOP), and memory management** in **C++**, using **linked lists** for playlist organization.

---

## 📜 **Project Overview**
### **What This Project Does**
✅ **Loads a catalog of songs** from a `.txt` file.  
✅ **Creates and manages personal playlists** dynamically.  
✅ **Plays songs**, removing them from the playlist.  
✅ **Displays available songs & playlists.**  
✅ **Implements linked lists & dynamic memory allocation** (manual memory management).  

This project is a **strong example of data structures, recursion, and OOP principles in C++.**

## 🛠 **Key Skills Demonstrated**
- **C++ Development**: Memory management, file handling.
- **Data Structures**: **Singly Linked Lists** (for playlists), **Vectors** (for catalog storage).
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
  - **Encapsulation** (Private Variables & Getters/Setters)
  - **Operator Overloading** (`<<` for printing song details)
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Recursion for **playlist navigation & searching**.
- **Debugging & Memory Safety**: Preventing leaks via **proper destructor use** (`~Playlist`, `~MusicPlayer`).

## 🎮 **How It Works (Simplified)**
### **Program Functionality**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **🎵 Load Songs** | Reads a song catalog from `proj3_music.txt`. |
| **➕ Add Song** | Adds a song to the user’s playlist. |
| **📜 Display Playlist** | Lists all songs in the user’s playlist. |
| **▶️ Play Song** | Removes the song from the playlist after playing. |
| **🚪 Exit Program** | Safely terminates execution and clears memory. |

This program **does not use built-in C++ STL lists**—instead, it demonstrates **manual linked list implementation**, reinforcing **low-level programming concepts**.

## 🚀 **Why This Matters**
This project highlights my ability to:
✔️ **Work with complex data structures in C++**.  
✔️ **Apply OOP principles effectively**.  
✔️ **Manage memory efficiently to avoid leaks** (no STL lists used).  
✔️ **Write clean, structured, and modular code.**  

It showcases skills relevant to **software engineering, game development, and low-level systems programming.**

### ✨ **Final Thoughts**
UMBC Music Player is a **C++ project that builds foundational programming skills** through **linked lists, memory management, and algorithmic problem-solving**.
