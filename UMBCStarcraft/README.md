# 🌌 UMBC Starcraft

UMBC Starcraft is a **C++ text-based strategy game** where players explore a hostile alien world, battle enemies, and navigate a dynamically generated map. This project was developed for **CMSC 202 – Computer Science II** at **UMBC (University of Maryland, Baltimore County).**  

The project demonstrates **inheritance, polymorphism, object-oriented programming (OOP), and dynamic memory management** in a multi-class C++ application.

## 📜 **Project Overview**
### **What This Project Does**
✅ **Simulates a turn-based strategy game** inspired by Starcraft.  
✅ **Uses a dynamic map** with interconnected areas.  
✅ **Implements combat mechanics** for player-controlled Terran units vs. AI-controlled Zerg units.  
✅ **Uses object-oriented principles** such as **inheritance & polymorphism**.  
✅ **Manages memory dynamically** to allocate/deallocate entities.  

This project **demonstrates structured C++ programming, game logic, and OOP fundamentals**.

## 🛠 **Key Skills Demonstrated**
- **C++ Development**: Multi-file program structure, makefiles, object-oriented design.
- **Data Structures**: **Vectors** (for storing dynamic entities), **pointers** (for entity memory management).
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
  - **Encapsulation & Classes** (`Game`, `Entity`, `Terran`, `Zerg`, `Area`).
  - **Inheritance & Polymorphism** (shared base classes for Zerg & Terran entities).
- **Memory Management**:
  - **Dynamic allocation** (`new` and `delete` for entities and areas).
  - **Ensuring zero memory leaks** (tested with `valgrind`).
- **AI & Game Logic**: Randomized enemy spawns, combat system.

## 🎮 **How It Works (Simplified)**
### **Program Functionality**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **🌍 Dynamic Map** | Players explore procedurally connected areas. |
| **⚔️ Combat System** | Players battle Zerg enemies with normal & special attacks. |
| **📊 Player Stats** | Tracks health, rests, and special attacks. |
| **🚀 Randomized Encounters** | Moving into new areas may trigger AI enemy spawns. |
| **📍 Multi-Class Design** | Players choose between Marine, Ghost, or Battlecruiser. |

### **Gameplay Example**
1️⃣ **Player selects a class (Marine, Ghost, or Battlecruiser).**  
2️⃣ **Explores the map, moving between connected areas.**  
3️⃣ **Encounters Zerg enemies with a 25% spawn chance per area.**  
4️⃣ **Chooses to attack, move, or rest (if no enemies are present).**  
5️⃣ **Combat proceeds via turn-based mechanics with regular & special attacks.**  
6️⃣ **Game continues until the player quits or is defeated.**  

The game features **different enemy types (Zergling, Mutalisk, Hydralisk)** with varying **attack styles and health values**.
